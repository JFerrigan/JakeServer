Okay, how to do stuff for john & powell <3.

Step 1: checkout this repo. Use git clone & the https link. Straight forward enough.
You might need to set up tokens or credentials. If so ask GPT.

Step 2: set up yout environment
ask GPT how to install dotnet & docker

Step 3: Build images and run them. Use these commands:
docker build -t jake-server .
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 jake-server

Step 4: Make a branch, make changes, commit them, & push!
git checkout -b <branchname>
...make changes...
git add .
git commit
git push --set-upstream origin <branchname>

Thats all folks! 
Now go add some features.
